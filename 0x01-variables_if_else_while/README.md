## Learning Objectives
With the development of this project you learn the following:

#### * What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

Arithmetic operators are the very basic operators between two or more variables. These are addition, substraction, multiplication, division and modulus. Depending on what result you want to obtain, there are useful tools to do some procedures.

_Name_           | _Symbol_| _Description_                   |
-----------------|---------|---------------------------------|
Plus             |    +    |Calculates the adition operation |
Minus            |    -    |Performs the substraction        |
Asterisk         |    *    |Multiplication sign              |
Slash            |    /    |Exact division symbol            |
Percent          |    %    |Divides and operates with module |
