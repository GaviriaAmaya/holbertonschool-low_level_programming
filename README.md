# Low Level Programming

## Learning Objectives.
In every project, learning objectives are answered to be an effective way to consolide the knowledge of each task or project

#### * C programming (Pending)
C programming allows you to learn the logic of the programming and have better practices in a real world. If I'd have to learn to program again, I'd choose C for sure.

#### * Compiled with ´gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra´ (Flags explaination pending)
This is the way to compile your main C file. GCC is the GNU Compiler Collection. Works translating the Super High Level instructions (Human readable programming) into binary, passing through the preprocessing process, the compile process, the assembler code and linking.\
See [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper "Grace Hopper") (Yes, this is in your honor!)\
Also [this](https://medium.com/@729_78111/gcc-compile-et-impera-518d91cd25c1 "this")

#### * Holberton coding style: Betty
The C coding style of Holberton school is Betty coding style. It's inspired by the Linux Kernel coding style. Cloning the repository allows the installing option of Betty. Is executed as a command, being the first argument and followed by the files to be reviewed. Betty shows the line and the space of errors, if it's the case.\
See [Betty's Wiki](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki "Betty") Also, you can clone it

## Captain's log.
This section is dedicated to aha moments, some own troubleshooting, obvious things and knowledge for myself and others.
#### - README.md template
This is, for me, an academic template for all my README. Here I can use [links](about:blank), inline `code`
```c
Code snippets
```
And other shortcuts to write better README.
