# Low Level Programming
Project for learning the very basics of programming. Use of C programming language to solve some algorithms and create functions from the scratch

## Installing process
Just left to clone this repository. Every task will be shown on their respective README file, and how to be executed. Generally, the C programmming tasks will be compiled with 
GCC and some flags to get easier the learning process.

## Tasks
Every task will be refered and how it have to be compiled and executed

## Learning Objectives
In every project, learning objectives are answered to be an effective way to consolide the knowledge of each task or project

#### * Why C programming language?
C is the base of many modern languages. Is highly efficient, allows you to take a computational thinking step by step even in memory knowledge assignation and other stuff

#### * Compiled with ´gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra´
Every task on C programming will be compiled printing all warnings (-Wall, -Wextra), converting every warning into errors (-Werror) and rightly formatted with ISO C (-pedantic)
This allows you to take more control into the best practices and constantly reach a good code, through the logical step-by-step process even before to programming the problem

#### * Holberton coding style: Betty
The C coding style of Holberton school is Betty coding style. It's inspired by the Linux Kernel coding style. [Cloning the repository](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) allows the installing option of Betty. Is executed as a command, being the first argument and followed by the files to be reviewed. Betty shows the line and the space of errors, if it's the case.\
See [Betty's Wiki](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki "Betty") Also, you can clone it

## Captain's log.
This section is dedicated to aha moments, some own troubleshooting, obvious things and knowledge for myself and others.
