# 0x1E-search_algorithms

## Learning Objectives.


#### * What is a search algorithm
>C programming allows you to learn the logic of the programming and have better practices in a real world. If I'd have\ to learn to program again, I'd choose C for sure.

#### * What is a linear search
> Monsieur [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie "Dennis Ritchie")

#### * What is a binary search
> Dennis Ritchie was the creator of C programming language. Also, created the UNIX OS
> Brian Kernighan was the co-author of the book "C programming language". Technically, the man page of C. Also worked on UNIX developement
> Linus Torvalds is the creator of Linux Kernel. Also, is the principaal developer of it, and created the distributed version control Git

#### * What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs
> This is the way to compile your main C file. GCC is the GNU Compiler Collection. Works translating the Super High Level instructions (Human readable programming) into binary, passing through the preprocessing process, the compile process, the assembler code and linking.
> See [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper "Grace Hopper") (Yes, this is in your honor!)
> Also [this](https://medium.com/@729_78111/gcc-compile-et-impera-518d91cd25c1 "this")

## Work log.

##### - How to interact on Man Pages:
> Search </, ?>, navigate <n> and other shortcuts
> See <man --help>

##### - Concatenating commands to compile and execute program
> <compile> && <./name>

##### - Framework
> Follow the framework and RTFM

##### - Line wrapping commands
> Continue the commands and string literals with many options. From double quotes to backslash
> See [6-size.c](https://github.com/GaviriaAmaya/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c "6-size.c") and [How do I write a multi-line string literal in C?](https://jameshfisher.com/2016/11/30/c-multiline-literal/ "How do I write a multi-line string literal in C?")
